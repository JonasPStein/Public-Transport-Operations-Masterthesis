# Public-Transport-Operations-Masterthesis
Masterthesis of Jonas Stein at OVGU Magdeburg 2023
This respository provides GAMS code for public transport operations basing on a fictional created region for the network design, line planning, timetabling, and vehicle scheduling problem
I got support from Lorena Reyes-Rubiano to create the minimum spanning tree in the network design problem and also for the creation of the line pool in the line planning problem
